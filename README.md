## Pharmacy

[Here](./projects/farmacia-search/) This is a search enginge that consist on sending a petition get to a server that our teacher gave to us, that let us get all the pharmacies that are able in Mallorca. With JavaScript, css and html I created a simple filter.

There are 4 different kind of information that can be found: First, a petition with all the data. Second, a filter with an specific word included in the data. Third, all the data but filtered in towns. And finally, an specific ID search engine that includes all the information that is stored about a single pharmacy adding also a map... using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) an open source pluging for javaScript that allows us making it.

## SpamDominio

[Here](./projects/spamdominio/) you will find the first "program" that we learnt to understand how petitions get works, and how can we interact with JavaScript and Data without making anychanges at the html, making the web page more dinamic.

It consist in a button, that make NXN petitions to find which domains of web pages are free or taken. Just searching for a pre-defined string that starts with "a" and ends with "ib.com".

## RandomNumber

[Here](./projects/random-number/) is located the exercise that consisted in creating a virtual machine, convert it into a apache server and conecting this program to it. So we could get a random number from 1 to 99, if it is bigger than 50, it will appear in green else in red.

It was our first look about the full cicle of web development.

PD: Just working if there is a working ip returning a number from 1 to 99.
